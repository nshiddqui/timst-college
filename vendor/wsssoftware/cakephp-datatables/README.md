This branch is for use with **CakePHP 4.0+**. For details see [version map](https://github.com/wsssoftware/cakephp-datatables/wiki#cakephp-version-map).


This is a very simple and minimalistic (Automagic) implementation of
[DataTables jQuery Plugin](https://datatables.net/) for CakePHP.
If you need to create simple and basics DataTables tables without extremely hard configurations, this will be a very wise choice.

Overall functionality is inspired and improved by one plugin from CakepPHP 2.x that isn't longer available.

The plugin is an attempt to provide a basic, simple and friendly way to implement the
DataTables library in order to be connected with CakePHP features and requirements.

## Installation and Usage
See [Documentation](https://cakephp-datatables.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
